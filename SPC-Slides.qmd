## Spatial microsimulation for ‘what-if’ scenario modelling at national scale in great Britain {.smaller}


The SPC makes it easier for researchers to work with synthetic population data in Great Britain. It combines a variety of data sources and outputs a single file in protocol buffer format, describing the population in a given study area, with a particular focus on socio-economic characteristics and interactions between individuals.


## How does it work?

## Context – Motivation {.smaller}

- Combining censuses (fine-scale but limited range of attributes) with surveys (more variables but coarse scale and small sample sizes) and mobility data 

- Pitfalls: High computational requirements, excessive complexity, limited coverage

- **Four areas of improvement**: variability estimation; reusability; explicit results for policymakers; and integration with big data streams for what-if scenario modelling (Tanton, 2017)

- “What needs to be done rather than what can be done” (Spiekermann& Wegener)

- Focus on socio-demographic characteristics and interactions among individuals

## Lineage 

**Dynamic Micro-simulation for Epidemics (DyME)**:

*Is there a pre-existing model of human social behaviour and contacts into which new SEIR type labels for disease state can be introduced, with appropriate statistics for changing these labels?*
